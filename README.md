# Mathematical Modeling and Data Science in Tumor Evolution

This repository contains materials for the **Mathematical Modeling and Data Science in Tumor Evolution** course. The course covers:
- **Mathematical models** to represent complex biological systems.
- **Population genetics** principles in cancer evolution.
- **Numerical methods** for solving ordinary differential equations.
- **Stochastic branching processes** for understanding tumor-immune coevolution.

## Repository Contents
- `data/`: Contains datasets used for simulations and analysis.
- `notebook.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with hands-on exercises and model implementations.
- `README.md`: Overview of the project.

## Getting Started
